SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS for ASSIGNMENT 2
========================================================

Submission should be uploaded to CANVAS by the due date. 
Late submissions will be applied a penalty based on the late submission policy (to be announced).

One zip file (.tar.gz, .zip) must be submitted for each assignment, named with Lastname_Fistname_Assignment_X e.g. If your name is "Jane Doe" and you are submitting assignment2, your folder name should be "Doe_Jane_Assignment_2"

In this zip file, mandatory files are:
	1.Source Code: location_updater.c
	2.Makefile: compiles source codes and generates executable files
	3.ReadMe.txt: instructions for compiling and executing executable file in a desired way

*** Code ending up with compilation errors will not receive any credits. Feel free to reach out to the Instructor and the TA for any questions. ***

Special instructions:
	* Do not upload the generated executable files, or other binaries. You are required to submit the source code instead.
	* The Makefile should work with: $ make on the terminal, generating 1 executable binary:
		location_updater：	$./location_updater ${# of buffer entries} < input.txt 
	* Test code before submission: If not mentioned to generate output to a file, all output results should be displayed on console directly with stdout.
	* Please use standard C/C++ libraries so that we can easily compile your code on our system. Test platform will be a virtual machine built on vanilla an Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 image.
