Output: A sequence of calendar events

Input is read from standard input and std out is used for the Output
Each line of the input will be used to represent an email

Abstract Idea: "Subject:String"
Examples: 
    C,title,MM/DD/YYYY,HH:MM,location -> Create an event with the given title, date, and time 
    D,title,MM/DD/YYYY,HH:MM,location -> Delete an event with the given title, date, and time 
    X,title,MM/DD/YYYY,HH:MM,location -> Change the event with the matching title using the provided date, time, and, location

Requirements: 
Both the title and the location are required to be of length 10. 
If the actual string is shorter, it must be padded with the space character. 
Note that the Email Filter program will not take any of the actions specified above. 
Instead, it will write the subject string if it matches one of the event types and well-formed. 


Takeaways:
This code is so that you only filter out useful information from the standard in
